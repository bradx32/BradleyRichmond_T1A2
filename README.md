### Welcome to my Portfolio Readme file. 

### Purpose:
The purpose of my portfolio website is to work as an online resume, provide information about me and showcasing my work with project pages and blogs. A represenation of myself to any developer or IT professional employers. The site will gradually change over time as current work and projects are updated.




### Functionality/features:
- What youre trying to do with the components you created on the site
- How youre trying to grab or bring peoples attention across pages of the site.

- The main functionality of the Home page is 
- My portfolio page features a Navigation bar in the Header section to provide an easy location to jump between the pages. 
- The home page has a 'Contact Me!' link that takes you straight to the contact page where you can fill out a form and submit
- At the beginning of each page there is a colourful and responsive H1 heading with a hover effect. This helps engage the user while knowing exactly what page they have navigated to.
- There are several links to Socials (LinkedIn & Github), Resume (mockup), previous projects and my GITHUB repository. These are located with either an image button link or text via 'Home', 'About' and 'Projects' pages.
- I also decided to include a link to Home button with a house icon at the top left of the screen viewport across all pages to navigate back to the home page. This image icon also has a smooth hover effect animation for improved interaction.

### Target audience: 
The target audience I would be after is a Developer/IT employer looking for Junion Developers that have a range of skills on creating simple websites with a set colour scheme, blog post pages and form pages. My home page shows the coding languages I can work with as well as mentioning in my About page that I'm currently studying with Coder Academy, a well known and accredited bootcamp. My portfolio provides a brief description of who I am with an example of the HTML pages I can create with CSS styling.
